-Download the files and put them on your web server. If you do not have a dedicated one or don't even know that that is, use xampp's by going to the directory \\<yourpcname>\c\xampp\htdocs and putting them there. 

-To access the WebDB, you have to go to your web browser and type localhost. If you have it on a different system, use that system's internal ip address, or external ip address.
